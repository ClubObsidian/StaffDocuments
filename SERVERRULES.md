# Chat Rules
### Cursing is allowed, but cursing to harass others is not.
### Mutes for chat related offenses are handled in the time order of: 5m -> 15m -> 30m -> 1h -> 1d -> 1w -> permanent
#### These are all general rules that staff members use as a guideline. Ultimately, it is up to the staff member at the time to make the decision what the proper punishment should be for what is done.

##### 1. Don't spam the chat

Having **3+** messages in the chat box **is** considered spam! We go based off of the staff's chat box, which is usually around 20 lines, but may vary by staff member.

* If they are all the same or similar messages you can mute but a player may be having a conversation so use common sense when muting

#### 2. Don't flood the chat

Flooding the chat is using excessive, unnecessary amounts of letters, numbers, and other characters. Example being: "wcvjgmnotwkujwcv" or "OOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOSHHHHH". This may be called spam by a staff member.
Sending multiple one word messages will also be considered flood.
Example: 
"This"
"is"
"annoying"
"and"
"not"
"allowed"

#### 3. Don't use unicode characters
Anything outside of ASCII characters is not allowed.

#### 4. Don't use CAPS, **3** or more words in one message is considered an excessive use of caps. 

Example: "THIS IS CAPS" "ThIs IS StILl CaPs."
Additionally attempting to use caps in multiple messages in just an attempt to bypass this rule, and is not allowed.
You may also be muted for being a smartass. Example: "CAPITAL LETTERS"

#### 5. Don't attempt to cause spam in chat.

Saying you are going to give away something if someone says something in chat or similar is not allowed.

#### 6. No posting links in chat

The only exception to this rule is Twitch or YouTube rank advertising their channels or somebody posting a link from our services.

* Twitch/Youtube can only post links to their videos and channels no one elses.
* If a player is requesting help and posts a screenshot check it first and then mute if necessary

#### 7. Don't harass other players.

Constantly calling someone names or insulting them in any way is not allowed.
The punishment depends on severity of the offence.

Examples being: Boston Marathon Bombing, 9-11, The Holocaust, ISIS attacks on Belguim & Paris.
Punishment for poking fun at these events varies depending on the context.

#### 11. No adult content. Keep it **PG-13**. 

Any talk of any adult related content is strictly prohibited.
Any attempt to link to adult websites will result in a permanent ban.
Any talk of adult content is mutable with the punishments being 1h -> 1d -> permanent
When quoting someone who stated some adult content, such as the example below, the mute may be shortened to 15m for the first offence based on the staff member's discretion. 

Examples of Adult Content

# Behavior

#### 2. Don't harass others.

#### 3. Use common sense. **Think before you act!**

#### 4. Trying to get punished on purpose will result in a **longer punishment**.

#### 5. You are responsible for actions on your account. 

Example: If you let your friend play and they break the rules, you are **100% Liable!**

#### 6. Don't purposely attempt to go around, or evade the rules.

#### 7. Don't try to trade out of game items for anything ingame.

#### 8. No attempting to distribute, sell, or purchase minecraft or other types of accounts.

#### 9. No distributing other player's personal information.

#### 10. No impersonating staff, this includes statements such as "hey guys I'm staff" and "do this because I am staff".
#### This can also include things such as changing your /nick to a staff member's or making a tag that is a staff member's In Game Name or in game Nickname.


# Other ingame behavior

#### 1. No trapping people in nether portals.

#### 2. Scamming people ingame, for ingame items or ingame money is allowed, but discouraged because it can have a negitive effect on your reputation as a player. Scamming people for real-life money is not allowed. Example: If you make a deal with another person that you will buy them a rank, a rank is purchased for the other player, but they don't give the items and/or money owed, that is a real-life money scam. If a player says they will buy you a rank, and you pay them money and they leave, it is still considered an ingame scam. 

#### 3. No inappropriate plot builds. Don't build on your plot what wouldn't be allowed in chat. This includes, but is not limited to, anything listed in the rules.

#### 4. No using alternate accounts to cover up breaking the rules on another account. Example: You use a hacked client on an alternate account, so your main account with a donator rank doesn't recieve the punishment.
